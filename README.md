Rudra Dev — Data Analytics Portfolio

I believe data is not about dashboards.
It’s about decisions, clarity, and reducing chaos inside organizations.

I come from a background where operations are real, deadlines are tight, and mistakes are expensive.
That environment taught me one thing early: insights matter only when they are usable.

This repository is a collection of projects where I’ve applied analytics to solve practical business problems — across operations, sales, finance, and enterprise reporting.

What I Do

I work at the intersection of business understanding and data execution.

I help teams:

Turn raw, scattered data into structured insights

Build reports and dashboards that leadership actually uses

Improve visibility across operations, performance, and decision-making

Reduce manual effort through cleaner reporting and automation

My strength lies in understanding the business first, and then choosing the right analytical approach to support it.

Skills & Tools I Work With

Data & Analysis :

SQL (advanced querying, joins, aggregations, performance-focused logic)

Advanced Excel (Pivot Tables, Lookups, Power Query, structured reporting)

Python (data analysis, scripting, exploratory analysis)

Visualization & BI : 

Power BI (DAX, modeling, performance optimization)

Dashboard design with focus on clarity and action

Business & Operations : 

KPI definition and tracking

Process analysis and reporting efficiency

Stakeholder communication across technical and non-technical teams

How I Think About Analytics

I don’t chase tools.
I chase clarity.

Every project follows the same philosophy:

Understand the business question

Identify the right data

Build only what adds decision value

Communicate insights simply and honestly

Good analytics doesn’t impress.
It helps.
