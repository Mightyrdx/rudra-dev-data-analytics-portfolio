AtliQ Hotel P&L Dashboard — Excel, Power Query, ETL
1. Problem

Hotels generate large volumes of financial data across revenue lines, operating costs, and overheads.
However, the finance team lacked a unified view of profitability trends, cost leakages, and branch-level performance. Monthly reporting was manual, inconsistent, and slow.

The objective was simple:
Build a P&L system that tells the truth quickly, clearly, and without manual effort.

2. Solution

I developed an automated Profit & Loss Dashboard using Excel and Power Query that transforms raw transactional data into structured, decision-ready financial intelligence.

The solution provides:

A consistent monthly P&L structure

Automated ETL pipeline (Power Query)

A dynamic financial dashboard that updates with a single refresh

Executive-level visibility into revenue, cost, and margin performance

This replaced manual spreadsheet work with a reproducible, audit-friendly process.

3. Data Processing Pipeline

The data pipeline follows three principles: clean, normalize, model.

a) Cleaning:

Removed duplicates

Standardized date formats

Normalized revenue & cost categories

Handled missing values and misclassifications

b) Transformation (Power Query):

Merged multi-sheet source data into one coherent model

Created branch and category hierarchies

Designed consistently formatted month-by-month structures

c) Modeling:

Constructed financial metrics used by real hotel P&L teams:

Revenue

Operating Cost

Gross Profit

Net Profit

Margin %

MoM change

Linked them to an interactive dashboard with pivot visuals and slicers

The pipeline is zero-touch: drop new data → refresh → analysis ready.

4. Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard provides a compact, high-signal summary of hotel financial performance:

Revenue

Breakdown by room, F&B, and ancillary services

Seasonal trends

Contribution analysis by branch

Cost

Operating expenses

Utilities, labor, overheads

Detection of abnormal cost spikes

Profitability

Gross and Net Profit

Margin analysis

Variance (MoM and YoY)

Cost-to-revenue ratios

The goal is not decoration. The goal is clarity per pixel.

5. Insights Gained

The dashboard reveals patterns that were previously invisible in raw Excel files:

High-revenue branches were not always high-margin due to escalating operating costs

Certain months consistently underperformed due to occupancy seasonality

Controllable cost categories (e.g., utilities and supplies) showed periodic spikes

Branches with stable revenue exhibited margin volatility, indicating operational inefficiency

These insights translate directly into actions for cost control and revenue optimization.

6. Impact

A finance team could integrate this dashboard into their monthly review process and save hours of manual preparation.
The structured model supports:

Faster decision cycles

Transparent branch comparisons

Early identification of financial risks

Strategic forecasting inputs

This project demonstrates competence in financial analytics, data modeling, and automated reporting pipelines — all essential skills in real corporate analytics environments.
