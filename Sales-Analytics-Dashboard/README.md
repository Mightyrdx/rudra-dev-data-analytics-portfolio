AtliQ Hotel PnL — Sales & Profit Analytics Dashboard
Overview

This project transforms raw hotel sales and profit data into business insights that drive better decisions. Rather than just building visuals, its purpose is to answer strategic questions like:

Which markets deliver the highest revenue?

Where are profit margins weakest?

Which customers and products contribute most to value?

This is a dashboard designed for leadership and operations teams to cut through complexity and focus on the decisions that matter.

Business Problem

AtliQ Hotels operates multiple properties across cities, but leadership lacked clarity on:

How each city contributes to revenue and profit

Which markets show underperformance

How customer and product segments impact financial outcomes

Without structured analytics, teams were relying on intuition — which slows decision-making and risks missed opportunities.

This dashboard turns ambiguity into clarity.

Key Insights

Revenue Concentration: Over a multi-year period, total revenue of ₹985M was generated, with the Delhi NCR market contributing over 50% of revenue, though its profit margin was relatively low.

Profit Hotspots: Some markets (e.g., Bhubaneswar) showed higher profit margins, highlighting where operations are most efficient.

Customer Impact: The top customers (e.g., ElectricalSara Stores) dominate revenue, revealing where retention and expansion efforts matter most.

Product Performance: Certain products, such as Prod318, contributed significantly to overall revenue, offering a cue for inventory and pricing strategies.

These insights help shift strategic focus from guesswork to evidence-based action.
